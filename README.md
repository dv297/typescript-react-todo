> A todo application written in TypeScript and React, based on the popular TodoMVC application.

Here is a version of the TodoMVC application written in TypeScript and React. The goal of doing this was for me to learn
TypeScript and see how it incorporates into React. I would love to contribute this back to TasteJS's original TodoMVC
but the project is still in search of maintainers and there are still many PR's that have not been reviewed, so I felt 
there would be a few barriers for me being happy with the state of my contribution. Still, I learned a lot and would
encourage new devs to implement their own TodoMVC! ❤️❤️❤️

All of the browser tests from the original TodoMVC passed for this rendition at the time of initial creation. I want to 
give a big thanks to all the original contributors to TodoMVC for creating a unique learning opportunity for everyone
wanting to learn the crazy new trends!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
